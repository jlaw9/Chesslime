# Chesslime

The goal is to take over your opponents slime by exploding onto their squares. You win once all your opponents are eliminated. The rules are simple. You can only place slime on an empty square or on one you "own"  (already have slime in). Each square has a limit of the number of squares adjacent to it (corners: 2, sides: 3, middle: 4). Once a square reaches its limit, it explodes adding one slime to each adjacent square and taking over any opponent's squares.

This game is being developed on the Unity platform. The C# code is in _Assets -> Scripts_

Slime Chess is currently available for Windows, Linux and as an Android app [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JE16qpMZC7-xIS9htMXUN5Q-3To5iILf?usp=sharing). Right now I just have the Windows and Linux versions available to play, but eventually I plan to get multiplayer working and publish it on Google Play and on the iOS app store.
